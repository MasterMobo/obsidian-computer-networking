Multiplexing is a method of transmitting **multiple messages** on the same channel.

For multiple signals to be shared on one medium, the medium needs to be divided.

A **Multiplexer (MUX)** combines signals from multiple sources and transmits then as one signal.

A **Demultiplexer (DEMUX)** divides the signal into multiple signals and sends it to the destinated users.

Multiplexing can be in 4 dimensions:
- Space
- Time: [[Time Division Multiplexing (TDM)]]
- Frequency: [[Frequency Division Multiplexing (FDM)]]
- Code: [[Code Division Multiplexing (CDM)]]
