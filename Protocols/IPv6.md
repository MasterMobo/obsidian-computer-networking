## 1. IPv6

**128 bit** address. Modern version of [[IPv6]]

Supposed to replace IPv4, but is still used in parallel.

Much larger address space, no need for subnetting.

More optimized than IPv4, simpler routing.

>To migrate from IPv4 to IPv6, we use ***tunneling***. This works by encapsulating the IPv6 header within the IPv4 packet.
